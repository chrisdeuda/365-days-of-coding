# 365DaysOfCoding
I have taken the challenge to consistently learn and code with the blockchain development

I'll be tweeting my progress with #100DaysOfCode hashtag on my twitter account [chrisdeuda](https://twitter.com/chrisdeuda).

This was inspired as well with the HFO ( High Frequency Output) where they create something everyday. I wanted to create something as well everyday.

## Main Goals

* Upgrade my skills using Modern Web Development Tools
* Get work on Remote in Startup Company that with high engineering culture ( Not Web Agency).


## Start Date
April 15, 2018

### Additional Rules


1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode | #100DaysOfBlockchain
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.

### What should be log here:
* It should be combinations of learning of technologies with specific output.
* Taking courses are okay as long as you are not just following the tutorial. You should explore as well on your own.
