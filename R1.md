**Thoughts:**
Last week, I decided to start to upgrade my skills in tech. So I go purchase a new course in Udemy related to setting up an advanced development environment using Docker container.

The way I learned before is by watching online videos and following the teacher. I thought learning docker would be too complicated thatâ€™s why I  end up buying the course. As I watched the few videos I got easily bored with the instructor talking a lot of technical jargons. My mind could no longer stand watching tutorials.  So I stop and look for something else.

I do some searching on some blog post online on how to use it without the need for explaining too much and just start doing real use cases. 

Reading the long blog tutorial seems activated my mind since I was trying to digest the information rather than just passively listening to it. It seems my mind just set on the hyperfocus. It was the same sensation when Iâ€™m trying to practice a new song in guitar. Iâ€™m actually slowing down and reading the information piece by piece and trying to make sense out of it.

Whenever I was stuck on specific problems on why the commands donâ€™t work I was searching online on what is the possible cause of it. Using this method seems really help a lot since you remember the quick shortcut rather than the instructor telling you the exact problems and what is the solutions for it. The solutions go to your left ear and move out to your right ear.

I really start to love the process of explorations rather than the person telling you the exact path. And now I have now better understanding on when to use these tools and some great hands-on experience within just one week and my mind was actually engage in the learning process.

## R1D6  April 18, Thursday

**Progress:**

* docker: Fix configuration in mysql database #learning
* docker: finally configure mysql with docker with laravel #learning
* docker: I play around as well on the laradock.

**Thoughts:**
I've been enjoying more the explorations on learning in blogs rather than watching course on udemy in a linear passions.

I like it when I'm just following my curiousity on how to achieved something rather than someone give the key to me.

On Laradockâ€”It was quite intersting that I just discover the laradock where a lot of images are already setup. This will surely helps a lot when setting up the docker. I'm glad that I've go with the basic first before diving into advance. You know there is always someone out there that will remove all of the complicated stuff for you. But it should always better to understand first the fundamentals so that you will know how to fix it just in case there is bugs or issues.

## R1D7-D8 April 19-20, Friday-Saturday

**Progress**:

* I was playing around with setting up ghost blog in my local machine using docker container.
* Successfully install in my mac

**Thoughts**:

When using docker it seems it was using a lot of storage when downloading images. As of the moment I have a lot of images in my Mac and there are duplicates.

I would like to be able to reuse some of the containers that I have so that I don't have to repeat on using it. My idea is that I should be able to resuse the exist containers in my local machine. Some sorts of central hub for all of the things that I need. It doesn't have to be really.

**Thoughts on Laradock**â€”It seems the laradock there is a lot of images that is ready to use. It was quite too bloated since there are a lot of configurations that I might don't need. Maybe I would just copy some of the configurations if I need them.

One thing that I would like to know in using docker is 
Things I would like to play around later:

* I wanted to know on how to setups Continous Developmentsâ€”Where if I merge codes in git master branch It would be able to automatically triggers codes on the my server.
* How to create a separate files or configs for local developments and productions development.
* Write blogs on my what I've learned about docker stuff
