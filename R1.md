**Thoughts:**
Last week, I decided to start to upgrade my skills in tech. So I go purchase a new course in Udemy related to setting up an advanced development environment using Docker container. 

The way I learned before is by watching online videos and following the teacher. I thought learning docker would be too complicated that’s why I  end up buying the course. As I watched the few videos I got easily bored with the instructor talking a lot of technical jargons. My mind could no longer stand watching tutorials.  So I stop and look for something else.

I do some searching on some blog post online on how to use it without the need for explaining too much and just start doing real use cases. 

Reading the long blog tutorial seems activated my mind since I was trying to digest the information rather than just passively listening to it. It seems my mind just set on the hyperfocus. It was the same sensation when I’m trying to practice a new song in guitar. I’m actually slowing down and reading the information piece by piece and trying to make sense out of it.

Whenever I was stuck on specific problems on why the commands don’t work I was searching online on what is the possible cause of it. Using this method seems really help a lot since you remember the quick shortcut rather than the instructor telling you the exact problems and what is the solutions for it. The solutions go to your left ear and move out to your right ear.

I really start to love the process of explorations rather than the person telling you the exact path. And now I have now better understanding on when to use these tools and some great hands-on experience within just one week and my mind was actually engage in the learning process.

**Thoughts:**
I've been enjoying more the explorations on learning in blogs rather than watching course on udemy in a linear passions.

I like it when I'm just following my curiousity on how to achieved something rather than someone give the key to me.

On Laradock—It was quite intersting that I just discover the laradock where a lot of images are already setup. This will surely helps a lot when setting up the docker. I'm glad that I've go with the basic first before diving into advance. You know there is always someone out there that will remove all of the complicated stuff for you. But it should always better to understand first the fundamentals so that you will know how to fix it just in case there is bugs or issues.
