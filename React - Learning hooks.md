### The Problem We Solved

Imagine every time you refresh the page, you're opening a new phone call to talk to someone. That's wasteful, right? That's what was happening with our Pusher connection - we were creating a new connection every time the page loaded.

### Our Solution

We created something called a "hook" (think of it as a helper tool) that does two main things:

- Checks if we already have a connection

- If we do, reuses it. If we don't, creates a new one

### The Code Explained Simply

- First, we created a new file usePusherConnection.js:

```js
export const usePusherConnection = () => {

// This tracks if we're connected or not

const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState('disconnected');

useEffect(() => {

// Check if we already have a connection

if (!window.Echo) {

console.log('Creating new Pusher connection...');

// If no connection exists, create one

window.Pusher = Pusher;

window.Echo = new Echo({...});

} else {

console.log('Using existing Pusher connection');

// If connection exists, use it!

}

  

// Listen for connection events

const pusher = window.Echo.connector.pusher;

// When connected successfully

pusher.connection.bind('connected', () => {

console.log('Connected to Pusher with socket ID:', pusher.connection.socket_id);

// Save connection info for later

localStorage.setItem('pusherConnection', JSON.stringify({

timestamp: Date.now(),

connectionId: pusher.connection.socket_id

}));

setConnectionStatus('connected');

});

  

// When disconnected

pusher.connection.bind('disconnected', () => {

console.log('Disconnected from Pusher');

setConnectionStatus('disconnected');

});

  

// If there's an error

pusher.connection.bind('error', (err) => {

console.error('Pusher connection error:', err);

setConnectionStatus('error');

});

}, []);

  

return { connectionStatus };

};
```


### What Each Part Does

- Connection Status
