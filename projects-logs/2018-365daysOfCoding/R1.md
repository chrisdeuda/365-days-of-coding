Challenge: ![Hackerrank challenge](/images/01-hackerrank-02.png)


**Thoughts:**
Last week, I decided to start to upgrade my skills in tech. So I go purchase a new course in Udemy related to setting up an advanced development environment using Docker container.

The way I learned before is by watching online videos and following the teacher. I thought learning docker would be too complicated thatâ€™s why I  end up buying the course. As I watched the few videos I got easily bored with the instructor talking a lot of technical jargons. My mind could no longer stand watching tutorials.  So I stop and look for something else.

I do some searching on some blog post online on how to use it without the need for explaining too much and just start doing real use cases.

Reading the long blog tutorial seems activated my mind since I was trying to digest the information rather than just passively listening to it. It seems my mind just set on the hyperfocus. It was the same sensation when Iâ€™m trying to practice a new song in guitar. Iâ€™m actually slowing down and reading the information piece by piece and trying to make sense out of it.

Whenever I was stuck on specific problems on why the commands donâ€™t work I was searching online on what is the possible cause of it. Using this method seems really help a lot since you remember the quick shortcut rather than the instructor telling you the exact problems and what is the solutions for it. The solutions go to your left ear and move out to your right ear.

I really start to love the process of explorations rather than the person telling you the exact path. And now I have now better understanding on when to use these tools and some great hands-on experience within just one week and my mind was actually engage in the learning process.

## R1D6  April 18, Thursday

**Progress:**

* docker: Fix configuration in mysql database #learning
* docker: finally configure mysql with docker with laravel #learning
* docker: I play around as well on the laradock.

![Hackerrank challenge](/images/02-docker-results.png)

**Thoughts:**
I've been enjoying more the explorations on learning in blogs rather than watching course on udemy in a linear passions.

I like it when I'm just following my curiousity on how to achieved something rather than someone give the key to me.

On Laradockâ€”It was quite intersting that I just discover the laradock where a lot of images are already setup. This will surely helps a lot when setting up the docker. I'm glad that I've go with the basic first before diving into advance. You know there is always someone out there that will remove all of the complicated stuff for you. But it should always better to understand first the fundamentals so that you will know how to fix it just in case there is bugs or issues.

## R1D7-D8 April 19-20, Friday-Saturday

**Progress**:

* I was playing around with setting up ghost blog in my local machine using docker container.
* I've got a little bit stuck on the configurations on blog 'cause it have something to do with the connections on the database and I end up looking for other alternatives tutorials.
* Successfully install it in my mac

**Thoughts**:

When using docker it seems it was using a lot of storage when downloading images. As of the moment I have a lot of images in my Mac and there are duplicates.

I would like to be able to reuse some of the containers that I have so that I don't have to repeat on using it. My idea is that I should be able to resuse the exist containers in my local machine. Some sorts of central hub for all of the things that I need. It doesn't have to be really.

**Thoughts on Laradock**â€”It seems the laradock there is a lot of images that is ready to use. It was quite too bloated since there are a lot of configurations that I might don't need. Maybe I would just copy some of the configurations if I need them.

One thing that I would like to know in using docker is
Things I would like to play around later:

* I wanted to know on how to setups Continous Developmentsâ€”Where if I merge codes in git master branch it would be able to automatically triggers codes on the my server.
* How to create a separate files or configs for local developments and productions development.
* Write blogs on my what I've learned about docker stuff

### Links and Referrence:
  * **[Docker compose file ghost](https://autoize.com/docker-compose-file-ghost/). ðŸ‘ˆThis link was pretty straight forward configurations and it works well.
  * [Hello, Blog! - An advanced setup of Ghost and Docker made simple (Updated 2018) ](http://www.coderunner.io/hello-blog-an-advanced-setup-of-ghost-and-docker-made-simple-2018/) ðŸ‘ˆThis article have a great explanations on each steps and codes.

## R1D9 April 21, Sunday

**Progress:**

* Plan on what I will going to learn next
* Read about Continuous Integrations using Jenkins


**Thoughts:**

I slow down a little bit on doing learnings today and just decide to just read something about continuous integrations with Jenkins and PHP. I remember that Laradock already have jenkins in it. I will try it out next.

## R1D11- April 24, Wednesday

**Progress:**

* I'll set up my previous projects on the laradock container in production
* Learn how to use webhooks for auto deployments


**Thoughts:**

I was stuck on configuring the laradock in my development environment while my laradock works on my products. There is some so sort of problem if there are a lot of abstractions â€˜cause you donâ€™t have control in the things that you are doing.

**When Using Laradock in Production:**
Iâ€™ve read somewhere that if you are using the laradock in production just create different configurations files that will only download the tools that you will be needed. As you know there are a lot of things going on with the laradock.

**On using Laradock built in Mysql latest(8~)**
There is a problem with using it. Something to do with the creations of the new users in the MySQL. The **solutions** is  you just need to revert back to the stable version **(MySQL 5.7)**

I was stuck as well on using phpmyadmin â€˜cause it was not automatically configured to connect with the MySQL. I still need to familiarize my self with it.

**Overall Learning Experience**
I like more the explorations of learning rather than going through the tutorials in one go. I know that a lot of video tutorials promise you that they will save you a lot of time â€˜cause they will give you some sort of shortcut. I prepare to explore it on my own and get stuck from time to time on particular problems.

## R1D12-D15, April 25 - April 30, Tuesday

**Progress:**

* Learned how setups the dockerized docker
* Setup my existing blogs to WordPress docker

**Thoughts:**

Iâ€™ve been using a lot the docker lately since thatâ€™s the thing that Iâ€™m currently learning. Itâ€™s crazy that I wanted to move all of my existing projects to it. And some of the clients wp sites that Iâ€™m managing on my one VPS site. As of the moment I have 3 small digital ocean node. Which Iâ€™m planning to move to one VPS so that I just need to manage one server.

**Explorations:**
It seems Iâ€™ve reached the point where I need to manage all of the containers in just one VPS in Digital Ocean. This is something that Iâ€™ve really curious about how to really manage it.

It was really nice to guide your learnings with your curiosity. I just try to learn something if I really need it to be able to solve a particular problem that I have.

This leads me to discover the traefic that manages all of the containers and doing the reverse proxy stuff. Kinda like the nginx reverse proxy. I still not yet try this and just scan for now the documents.

Iâ€™m learning this â€˜cause in the upcoming days I will be setting up some of my personal sites which is static and some Wordpress sites plus Iâ€™m planning to explore the ghost as my blogging platform for writing some long-form technical stuff.

Learning docker seems overkill at the beginning but it seems it will be really useful to those things that Iâ€™m using. Maybe I will try to blog as well if I manage to successfully setups my own infrastructure. I know a lot of developers hate develops â€˜cause it was kinda complicated but I start to like to it. haha

## R1D16, May 01, Wednesday

**Progress:**

*  Traefik successfully configures after trial and errors
*  Learned that it was not a good idea to use a shared database
* Learned to setups the vscode SSH. This was so fucking helpful

**Thoughts:**
This is the continuations of my self-study of using docker and Iâ€™m currently experimenting with my server in digital ocean. What I wanted to be able to as the end goal is to be able to host most of my sites and apps in just one VPS server in the digital ocean. This could be easily achieved using a basic NGINX reverse proxy server stuff. But my needs are different since I have some sites in Wordpress, laravel and some vue js.

So it would be better to put those things in different containers so that they will not be a conflict with each other in terms of requirements of the tooling.

**When using the Traefik:**

Iâ€™ve discovered yesterday about the **Traefik** which kinda works like reverse-proxy. Reverse proxy means only a few ports of your server are open to the outside world and the rest are hidden.

Before Iâ€™ve come reach this cool application. My current problem is that I have different containers and apps inside my VPS and Iâ€™m trying to figure out on how to make it work where if I type specific subdomain like blog.example.com it would point to specific containers.

Iâ€™ve done some basic tinkering with nginx before that points the sub-domain to specify folder but I need something similar which will handle it but it needs to point to specific containers.

**What I like about the Traefik:**

* SSL already configures for you. This is really cool features since I donâ€™t need to worry on the expirations of SSL every 3 months.
* Cool Dashboard to view all of your containers. This simple features really come in handy to view all of your running containers that points to a specific domain.


Iâ€™ve got stuck with blog tutorial on the digital ocean since it was a little bit outdated(2017) and some commands donâ€™t work anymore. So Iâ€™ve to browse the comment sections to see what people are sayings and what configuration works on theirs. After reading a few comments I try to combine different and Iâ€™ve managed to make it works. Yeay. Iâ€™m pretty with my current setups.

## R1D17-18, May 3, Friday

**Progress:**

* Look for inspirations in designs and layouts
* Create some layouts on figma #chrisdeuda
* Downgrade Php version to 7.0 to see if error will be remove using docker

**Thoughts:**

I start to love using docker for setting up a development environment

This month I decided to pick docker as a technology that I will be studying. At first, it was quite hard to grasp some of the concepts. But eventually, I start to get it. As for reference, I stop the udemy course that I purchase since it was too much theoretical and not enough practical applications.

Since I have some basic experience with it. Iâ€™ve decided to move my personal blog site to a dockerize container in my hosting. Before I was using Linode but Iâ€™ve decided to move to Digital Ocean since it was much more modern and there are a lot of options in my opinion.  I back up my WordPress sites and the database and I delete my monthly VPS.

Interesting that I could put a lot of stuff on my current $5/ month in my digital ocean account when I start using Docker.

On my Wordpress site, it was using 7.0 version of PHP but the current image that Iâ€™ve set up is using 7.3 so there are some broken parts of my site so it was a breeze to just change the docker configurations and docker will do the necessary changes for you. In a normal development environment, this will be hard to implement since it might affect the other applications that you have.

I know that they are some simple tools such as Heroku but I prefer to set up on my own since I have some custom setups that I will be doing soon such as I will use ghost platform for my technical blog that I will write soon together with my Wordpress on its side.

Plus Iâ€™ll be using my current setup to host some of clients projects that donâ€™t have yet hosting but needs a beta link in order to view the updates on their site. Ohh Iâ€™ll be putting here some of my hobby project that Iâ€™ll be making.

I will write more about my experience in docker for my technical blog once I set it up.

## R1D19, June 04, 2019
I forgot to log some of my updates when I'm practicing using the docker. I've already comfortable on using it.

## R1D20, June 05, 2019

**Progress:**

* âœ… Get back on logging my learnings
* âœ… Started on learning React JS as part of my goal this year to move to modern javascript framework

**Thoughts:**

> As part of my goal this year to upgrade my tooling in web development last month I've learned and practice using Docker and this month React JS will be on my list to learn.

Today, I've finally started learning React JS after a long time resisting on learning this tech. I've already played around and built a production level project with VueJS before in my freelance projects.

This time I decide to move to React there is far more demand in this market.

I resisted on going to Udemy video tutorials since I've changed my style on learning. I want a hands-on thing where I could play around with the tools and just use the blog post as a guide. Let my self get stuck and try to figure out the solutions using StackOverflow. I like more this approach rather than just following what the teacher sayings on the video.

It feels like you are really progressing when you mindlessly copy their code. It was too safe for me and doesn't really help me much on progressing.

On a technical level, it seems it was really the same with the VueJS that uses Reactivity and States for managing the flow of the data from parent and child component. I just use the Create React App command line to generate all of the necessary code.

The *Create React App* and *Vue CLI* is such a godsend if you don't want to build things from the scratch and configuring the web pack and bundle stuff. Those are real time savers. Maybe at some point in the future, I'll try to learn the web pack thing.

I started my journey by trying to make it work the *Tic Tac Toe* blog tutorial in their official site.

Luckily I made some progress and I try to solve as well the additional challenge on their site where there is some task that you will implement on your own.

---

Soon, I think I might move some of my pet projects on React JS to familiar more myself with the tools.

P.S. I keep repeating my learning style so that I will not forget about it.

## R1D21, June 06, 2019

> Currently Learning React JS and playing around with [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

### **Progress: on Tictactoe**

* Read some documentation of ReactJS focuses on states and passing of data
* Get stuck on manipulating existing DOM elements render in  JSX
* Completed the task: When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.

### **Thoughts:**

**Trying to select existing DOM Rendered by JSX**
I was stuck on finding solutions in how I could select specific keys of squares that are generated dynamically. Kind the same way in jQuery where you can select and filter specific <li> with specific id or class. I was redirected to [Forwarding refs to DOM components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html#forwarding-refs-to-dom-components) but it was not the one that I'm looking for.

I need to do it so that I could mark the specific square that is completed the winning moves of the user. It's for the extra task on the Tic-Tac-Toe `When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.`.

Since I could find how to do it in JSX syntax. I just created an array to store the state of a square if it's marked as active or not. In this way, I don't need to manually select the DOM. Since it can automatically toggle the DOM on-off since it was doing the reactive thing.

![Tic-Tac-Toe With red marks when win](images/02_tictactoe_redmarks.gif)

**Encountered Infinite Loop when I added set updates in render method**

On related notes about, I've encountered an infinite loop while I was trying to debug the States value. I was wondering why it was still printing values in the console log even the match is already finished.

Then I found that it was a bad idea to put a setState in the render function. 'cause every time the States values getting the update it always renders the UI. So basically it creates an infinite loop. I didn't notice it immediately until my laptop slowly creating noise because of a fan. And my chrome browser was lagging.

Here is the post about ["Calling setState in render causes infinite loop" in react](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55722138/calling-setstate-in-render-causes-infinite-loop-in-react)

**Finally:**
I've finished the Tic-Tac-Toe additional task. I just have an idea: Maybe I could make it playable online by two players where it will use some sort of socket so that it will automatically be updated in real time. If I pursue this probably I need some backend to do it. Maybe node js.

The way I imagine it, it will work like a chat where it will be waiting for another user to send their shot. If I got more time, maybe I'll try this.

P.S. It was nice to slow down and just log what happen in your learning. It might not make sense to other people at least I've write down on how I tackle specific problem that might be good referrence at some time in the future.
