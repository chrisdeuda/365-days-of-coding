- Progress:
  - Started coding and made good progress.
### Next Actions:
  - Learn the Context API to refactor and manage state more effectively for data processing.
### Insights:
  - Used Claude to generate a basic view and HTML structure. (Hah!)
  - Considering refactoring previous projects (e.g., work done for Sevron) and converting them to React for better familiarity and hands-on coding practice.
  - This approach will help me practice coding and build the features I want, making it easier to implement useful functionalities.
