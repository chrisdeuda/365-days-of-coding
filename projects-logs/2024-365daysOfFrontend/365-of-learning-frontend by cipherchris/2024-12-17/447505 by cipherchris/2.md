Added a reusable forms for editing and creating new products.

interersting how easy it is to write and genereate code right now. I just do a minimal supervisions with the code generated and few prompts with the bugs changes…

For the reusable components it seems it was so easy to use it. and you just need to configure how it will works and this will gonna be flexible enough…

Here is the more break down on what I’ve did today:

1.  Reusability: Creating reusable components, like your ProductModal, significantly reduces code duplication and makes maintenance easier. It's a cornerstone of efficient React development.
2.  Flexibility: As you've noticed, well3. designed components can be easily configured for different use cases (like editing and creating) with just a few prop changes.
4.  Rapid prototyping: AI5. assisted coding allows for quick generation of boilerplate code and common patterns, speeding up the development process.
6.  Code review importance: Your point about "minimal supervision" is crucial. While AI can generate code quickly, human oversight is still essential to ensure the code meets specific project requirements and follows best practices.
7.  Learning opportunity: Working with AI8. generated code can be a great learning experience, exposing you to different coding patterns and approaches.
9.  Iterative development: The process of generating code, identifying bugs, and making refinements aligns well with agile development practices.
10.  Customization: Despite starting with generated code, you still have full control to customize and optimize it for your specific needs.
11.  Time efficiency: This approach can significantly reduce the time spent on repetitive coding tasks, allowing you to focus on more complex aspects of your application.
12.  Consistency: Using a consistent approach for similar functionalities (like edit and create) improves the overall user experience and maintainability of your code.
13.  Scalability: As your project grows, having reusable components makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without major refactoring.
