- I was able to make it work the Pusher.js in the frontend. the original problems tha I had is that the frontend was not receeving the data, after debugging for almost 1 hours, and I switch to using th[e cursor.](http://cursor.ai)ai.  I was able to make it works.
  - The catch here is that I need to add dot “ . “  in the events name, base on the explanations it seems it was the conventions being used in the Laravel. That was interesting that took me an hour in order to spot it.
  - somehow this make sense the original gneerated code with dot on it, but I change it because that’s not the name that I was genarating.
