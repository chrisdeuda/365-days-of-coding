- ON using laravel valet - made mistakes on trying to use the .local and I was trying to checks if I'm using the etc hosts, when I've added it it doesn't work. then I realized that I wanted I was using the Valet, which have default usages of the "test" folder.
  - I have to unlink the previeews url tha[t I'm us](http://using.It)ing.
  - It seems I was struggling to expose the URL that I have with the ngrox things and the vite and laravel valet I think might be great to be really just deploy it in the stagings environments.
