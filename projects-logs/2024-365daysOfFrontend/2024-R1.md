didn't be able to code much today, since have to process errands. will try again tomorrow since I was already sleepy today

![[CleanShot 2025-01-15 at 00.21.48@2x.png]]

I've pushed the changes and master branch from my clients, and I'll be honest I've not work on my main projects and I kinda miss it.

I think I don't want to be the same from last year. I think my main challenges right now is I'm not be able to sleep earlier.

but I think I have to prioritize the workout because it gives makes me tired and wanted to sleep already around 12, and this will give me a  early sleep so that I can work on.

- Got some practice codings with Frontend
	- I was modifying the templates of the emails
		- interesting to learn about making it reusbales 
		- interesting to know that you can use some sort of embed
-  
Summary of Actions:

1. You created an email header component for reusability across different email templates.
2. You implemented a system to embed images (both logo and background) in the email using Laravel's $message->embed() method.
3. You attempted to use a background image for the email header, along with a logo image.
4. You added logging and file checking mechanisms to debug image loading issues.
5. You tried various approaches to make the component flexible, allowing for optional background images and customizable logo properties.

Challenges Encountered:

1. Background Image Loading: The main challenge was getting the background image to display correctly across different email clients. You encountered an error "ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME" when trying to load the background image using Content-ID (CID).
    
2. Compatibility Issues: Different email clients have varying levels of support for CSS properties and HTML attributes, especially for background images.
    
3. Flexible Component Design: Creating a component that could handle both scenarios - with and without a background image - while maintaining compatibility was challenging.
    
4. Debugging in Email Environment: Identifying issues in email templates is challenging due to the variety of email clients and their rendering differences.
    
5. Balancing Compatibility and Functionality: You needed to find a solution that worked across various email clients while still achieving the desired visual effect.
    
6. Code Reusability: Ensuring that the component remained reusable and easy to implement in different email templates while handling various scenarios was a concern.
    

Resolution Approach:

- You moved towards using $message->embed() consistently for both background and logo images.
- You considered using inline images instead of CSS background properties for better compatibility.
- You implemented error logging and file checking to help diagnose issues.
- You maintained the existing structure of your email template while making minimal necessary changes to improve compatibility.

Insights:
- One thing I realized when learning a new languages, makes the AI generated code you study it and not just doing a copy pasting, because if you didn't do it, it was a bit struggle and you gonna spend more time trying to debugging it with AI.
	- at least right now that's what I'm trying to practice when generating code that I'm not familiar I wanted to learn it and it's okay to probably manually typing it so that you can familiar yourself with the syntax
	- Also one thing I realized I'm trying to document what I'm learning right now, having a beginner mindset and attitude that you will gonna figure it out along the way. That was something
- Also, it seems I can use this realizations and insight and can be structures as a post or contents /  twitter / IG
	- Probably then one thing I realized right now, may be I can creaate a tools and software that will helps me to be able to craft a contents from my initial prompts and then structure it to differnt platforms. Reminds me about the content biz on the skool before that I see that they are doing some sort of generating contents.

	- before i've used a checkbox in here. but later i realized that i wanted to just select one.

	- and then later i found a bug that it was not updating the text

- the bugs:
	- it seems it was about group the options into one, and the radio button works if they have the same names


- 11:59 then now it makes me wonder why it have delays on the updatings of the ui.


- this seems i wanted to exercise on how i can debug the frontend. without relying too much on the ai for debugging it.

  

- i almost forgget about the `debugger` keyword in here

On Queue worker 
- finally abl

![[Fixes-queue-worker.gif]]

# The Queue Conundrum: A Laravel Adventure

Had this problems with Laravel Forge with Queue worker: it makes me curious why it was not working well after doing the deployment. and I had to run it manually.

It turns out I haven't fully create a queue worker in the UI. I thought it was already there. It turns out you need to manually trigger create it.

-- here is a more detailed thoughts on it

## The Initial Chaos

So here's what went down - my initial problem was like a domino effect of frustrations:

1. Queue jobs were being total slackers, not processing automatically after deployment.
2. The jobs only decided to work when I manually ran `php artisan queue:work`. Talk about high maintenance!
3. I had Laravel Horizon all set up, looking pretty, but it was just chilling there, ignoring the jobs completely.

## Digging for Root Causes

It got me thinking... what's really going on here? After some digging (and maybe a bit of hair-pulling), I figured out the root causes:

1. The queue worker was half-baked in the Laravel Forge UI. Classic rookie mistake, right?
2. There was this weird connection type mismatch - Redis vs Database. It's like they were speaking different languages!
3. No automatic worker process was running via Supervisor. Basically, the house was empty with no one watching the kids.

## The Turnaround

But hey, I got this! Here's how I turned it around:

1. Created a Queue Worker in Forge UI with the right settings:
    
    Copy code
    
    ```
    Connection: database (matching application's QUEUE_CONNECTION)
    Queue: default
    Rest Seconds When Empty: 1 (cut down from 10 for faster job pickup)
    PHP Version: 8.3
    ```
    
    It's like giving the worker a proper job description, you know?
    
2. Made sure the Deployment Script had the right commands:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    ```
    # Proper queue handling during deployment
    $FORGE_PHP artisan horizon:terminate
    $FORGE_PHP artisan queue:restart
    ```
    
    Gotta have the right instructions, right?
    
3. Cleaned up by removing unnecessary commands:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    ```
    ## Removed this as it's not needed with Forge worker
    ## $FORGE_PHP artisan queue:work
    ```
    
    Sometimes, less really is more in coding.

Got stuck with configurations that doesn't

The queue worker doesn't work
- seems need to make sure I restart it
- the laravel push notificaitons doesn't work
This make

I guess one thing I've learned here is I need to make sure when deploying is the enviroments.

I also struggle a bit with the permission and access in the files. it seems it was getting deleted.

Also, it was important to be able to updates the logs to daily. seems I like it more ..

3:51pm
it makes me curious how I can enable to queue worker automatically. Seems I need to setup the laravel horizon stuff.

One thing I realized on doing this without the docker, is that I need to setup and make sure that might local was in sycn with the settings. It would be great if I can just ship the whole docker container with this. 

but yeah, that ws soemthing that I will try to do later.

Been stuck on trying to configure the laravel. Seems I realized I need to make sure that the basic files was being loaded.

also it seems I was get stuck on trying to configure and fix the Builds in the Vite / React JS( Probably took me 2 hours here)


- Yeah, it makes me wonder why it was not pointing to the normal sites

- The nexst goal should:

- To be able to display a basic sites in php files in Laravel Forge,
- For managing the url seems I was thinking if

Then the next problems is to make sure when you browse the IP adress it should load the files. Right now it was not working and just doing a redirects. 

- I've already added some basics and try to troubleshoot the nginx
- For the mean time I configure my domain to use point to AWS

Next actions:

but somehow base on my end it was a good fee if you don’t want to deal with the backend stuff. and somehow it makes me curious if i need to have it, for the simple applications that i have

and somehow i move to reading about the strategy in marketing on how i will be approaching my marketing for the products that i’m building.

i guess i’ve feel the resistance on doing it, and somehow my mind get stuck with doing the back marketing, i realized it was a free tool with some sort of limitations. i realized i can have it like a free tools, with limitations, then i can use the advance before.

  - The catch here is that I need to add dot “ . “  in the events name, base on the explanations it seems it was the conventions being used in the Laravel. That was interesting that took me an hour in order to spot it.
  - somehow this make sense the original gneerated code with dot on it, but I change it because that’s not the name that I was genarating.

Added a reusable forms for editing and creating new products.

interersting how easy it is to write and genereate code right now. I just do a minimal supervisions with the code generated and few prompts with the bugs changes…

For the reusable components it seems it was so easy to use it. and you just need to configure how it will works and this will gonna be flexible enough…

Here is the more break down on what I’ve did today:

1.  Reusability: Creating reusable components, like your ProductModal, significantly reduces code duplication and makes maintenance easier. It's a cornerstone of efficient React development.
2.  Flexibility: As you've noticed, well3. designed components can be easily configured for different use cases (like editing and creating) with just a few prop changes.
4.  Rapid prototyping: AI5. assisted coding allows for quick generation of boilerplate code and common patterns, speeding up the development process.
6.  Code review importance: Your point about "minimal supervision" is crucial. While AI can generate code quickly, human oversight is still essential to ensure the code meets specific project requirements and follows best practices.
7.  Learning opportunity: Working with AI8. generated code can be a great learning experience, exposing you to different coding patterns and approaches.
9.  Iterative development: The process of generating code, identifying bugs, and making refinements aligns well with agile development practices.
10.  Customization: Despite starting with generated code, you still have full control to customize and optimize it for your specific needs.
11.  Time efficiency: This approach can significantly reduce the time spent on repetitive coding tasks, allowing you to focus on more complex aspects of your application.
12.  Consistency: Using a consistent approach for similar functionalities (like edit and create) improves the overall user experience and maintainability of your code.
13.  Scalability: As your project grows, having reusable components makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without major refactoring.

Progress:

Started tricking my brain to just get started, I tell myself I just need 15 minutes and no more no less.

I work on the small features where when you update the records, it will also automatically updates the other components.

This seems interesting way to be able to pass the components. I’ve use Claude for this and it was able to use those things.

Somehow it makes me curious about using the [[ShadCDN]] this seems interesting to use.

I guess I like it more to be able to use a micro commitment and just lowering the barriers for me for now, and doesn’t need to happen on doing it for like 2-3 hours. For me it was about building the momentum.

Somehow it makes me curious if I can join a community to be able to apply the things I’m learning and have a different people join and cheer them up.

just do a simple 15 minutes on there commitment.

I realized that I can do it before I start working for my cllients, just to make sure that I put my creative energy in my own endeavor first.
## Getting inspired
I think I was inspired reading the story from Vin, where he just get started on the industry that he was not familiar.

and the thing that get stuck with me is the volumes, and doing it 100 times from visa.

I guess that’s the key there,

and somehow I realized that I can sacrifice for now the morning social media usage that I’m doing in building things.

It seems my next plan is actually start practicing building something from the scratch, or watch videos regarding the topic. 

the thing with the current session is that I wanted to build something. Learning by doing.

So in my case I’ll continue with the laracast video
