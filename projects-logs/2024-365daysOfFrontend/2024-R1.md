Pushing to setup the testing sites.
I was able to play around with the Laravel Forge

- Expierementing with laravel forge,s

- It seems initially I was stuck with AWs error, but it turns out I need to setup my accounts to do the hobby and freetier.
- It took me a wahile to realize, I've already setup the necessary configurations for the AWS, but no lock

//need more info why I decided to use it

**1:00am**

stuck on with reading about caddy for setting up servers, and somehow get interesting on reading about the superbase for the setup of less backend. but somehow i was getting a mix signal with the reddit post. seems there is a lot of negativity on it.

but somehow base on my end it was a good fee if you don’t want to deal with the backend stuff. and somehow it makes me curious if i need to have it, for the simple applications that i have

and somehow i move to reading about the strategy in marketing on how i will be approaching my marketing for the products that i’m building.

i guess i’ve feel the resistance on doing it, and somehow my mind get stuck with doing the back marketing, i realized it was a free tool with some sort of limitations. i realized i can have it like a free tools, with limitations, then i can use the advance before.

**3:30pm**
i’ve tried do some playing around today with AWS but no luck, because the internet where i’m staying was not good. 

probably just gonna go back with doing some cooking and preparing some food.

I'm just keeping my commit mistakes right now via journalling here.

Updated the UI to use the radio button instead of the checkbox, because I realize it would be just select 1.

- I was able to make it work the Pusher.js in the frontend. the original problems tha I had is that the frontend was not receeving the data, after debugging for almost 1 hours, and I switch to using th[e cursor.](http://cursor.ai)ai.  I was able to make it works.
  - The catch here is that I need to add dot “ . “  in the events name, base on the explanations it seems it was the conventions being used in the Laravel. That was interesting that took me an hour in order to spot it.
  - somehow this make sense the original gneerated code with dot on it, but I change it because that’s not the name that I was genarating.


### 11-04 am

- /progress - started setting up queue worker things for background process
  - I've been installing the sales.
  - I gues my goals for tonight is to deploy this apps, and will be useful for now side by sides.

---
- ON using laravel valet - made mistakes on trying to use the .local and I was trying to checks if I'm using the etc hosts, when I've added it it doesn't work. then I realized that I wanted I was using the Valet, which have default usages of the "test" folder.
  - I have to unlink the previeews url tha[t I'm us](http://using.It)ing.
  - It seems I was struggling to expose the URL that I have with the ngrox things and the vite and laravel valet I think might be great to be really just deploy it in the stagings environments.

### 11:04am

Logs from the other day:

it seems it was a bit challwenging to rigth code right now here because there is no internet. But yeah, somehow it means that I almost forget the syntax on writing code from the scratch. I think I almost forgot how to write code form the scratch. May be I should challenge myself. Or just probably focus on reviewing my week
- Agenda, fix the url, and add ngxig

Play around with simple Comment generator for social mediaas.

Interestign flow, I’ve generated some prototype in typingmind. and then later combine it with the Claude and actually integrating this to the existing systems. Which just have a basic functionality.

- Generate a basic ui
- integrated a basic backend in connecting with the BE
- added loading icon

Added a reusable forms for editing and creating new products.

interersting how easy it is to write and genereate code right now. I just do a minimal supervisions with the code generated and few prompts with the bugs changes…

For the reusable components it seems it was so easy to use it. and you just need to configure how it will works and this will gonna be flexible enough…

Here is the more break down on what I’ve did today:

1.  Reusability: Creating reusable components, like your ProductModal, significantly reduces code duplication and makes maintenance easier. It's a cornerstone of efficient React development.
2.  Flexibility: As you've noticed, well3. designed components can be easily configured for different use cases (like editing and creating) with just a few prop changes.
4.  Rapid prototyping: AI5. assisted coding allows for quick generation of boilerplate code and common patterns, speeding up the development process.
6.  Code review importance: Your point about "minimal supervision" is crucial. While AI can generate code quickly, human oversight is still essential to ensure the code meets specific project requirements and follows best practices.
7.  Learning opportunity: Working with AI8. generated code can be a great learning experience, exposing you to different coding patterns and approaches.
9.  Iterative development: The process of generating code, identifying bugs, and making refinements aligns well with agile development practices.
10.  Customization: Despite starting with generated code, you still have full control to customize and optimize it for your specific needs.
11.  Time efficiency: This approach can significantly reduce the time spent on repetitive coding tasks, allowing you to focus on more complex aspects of your application.
12.  Consistency: Using a consistent approach for similar functionalities (like edit and create) improves the overall user experience and maintainability of your code.
13.  Scalability: As your project grows, having reusable components makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without major refactoring.

Progress:

Started tricking my brain to just get started, I tell myself I just need 15 minutes and no more no less.

I work on the small features where when you update the records, it will also automatically updates the other components.

This seems interesting way to be able to pass the components. I’ve use Claude for this and it was able to use those things.

Somehow it makes me curious about using the [[ShadCDN]] this seems interesting to use.

I guess I like it more to be able to use a micro commitment and just lowering the barriers for me for now, and doesn’t need to happen on doing it for like 2-3 hours. For me it was about building the momentum.

Somehow it makes me curious if I can join a community to be able to apply the things I’m learning and have a different people join and cheer them up.

just do a simple 15 minutes on there commitment.

I realized that I can do it before I start working for my cllients, just to make sure that I put my creative energy in my own endeavor first.
## Getting inspired
I think I was inspired reading the story from Vin, where he just get started on the industry that he was not familiar.

and the thing that get stuck with me is the volumes, and doing it 100 times from visa.

I guess that’s the key there,

and somehow I realized that I can sacrifice for now the morning social media usage that I’m doing in building things.

## insert title
- feature/products/products-pages, origin/feature/products/products-pages) chore: add prettier
- feat: add sync of products edit to main component

Fixes the Edit buttons can save now the funcdtionality.

Fixes the product pages now - we can see the product sections

I was troubleshooting the endpoint in the backends, because of the wrong urls paths, and somehow there is a error with how we are calling the codes

```
// Route::prefix('api')->group(function () {
// Route::post('product', [AdminProductController::class, 'store'])->name('admin.product.store');
// Route::post('product/{id}', [AdminProductController::class, 'update'])->name('admin.product.update');
// Route::get('orders', [AdminOrderController::class, 'index'])->name('admin.orders.index');
// });
```

this sections causes an error

It makes me wonder if it would be great if I was consistent enough on doing a FE task for like 30 minutes. Imagine how it will be after couple of months doing a FE task. since I know I’ve been in industry but haven’t really spend some time doing a FE task.

Damn, I wanted this changes to be more green, whenever I’m practicing just to be pracitice shipping small things

This reminds me that I need to switch my strategy in building something on the tools rather than trying to learn the ins and outs of this tools

- Progress:
  - Started coding and made good progress.
### Next Actions:
  - Learn the Context API to refactor and manage state more effectively for data processing.
### Insights:
  - Used Claude to generate a basic view and HTML structure. (Hah!)
  - Considering refactoring previous projects (e.g., work done for Sevron) and converting them to React for better familiarity and hands-on coding practice.
  - This approach will help me practice coding and build the features I want, making it easier to implement useful functionalities.

Short coding session with the FreeCode Camp

I’ve decide to do the coding like this and use theclaude to be able to generate a report thing.

From Sunday:
Copy pasted some of the Frontne UI thing.

Yeah, I’ve copy pasted the code only, and it turns out I need to be moving forward, and it was interesting to combine this with iPad if I need an extra monitor

I was expereimenting and wanted to create a chat UI that was similar to this one. hahaha. I think I realized that I can achieve it through using the arc browser hahaha..

This is really what I need, those it seems it was a good practice if ever I wanted to ?

It’s been my day 3 learnig the React… Yeah, I was learning it.

Right now I was a bit with using the ReactJS tuturoisl in FreeCode camp.

It seems I wanted to build something from the scratch and learn things on the Go. yeah, I somehow need to keep my mind get engage.

![[projects-logs/2024-365daysOfFrontend/365-of-learning-frontend by cipherchris/2024-10-11/439094 by cipherchris/1.png]]

I finish the Few percentage on using it.

It seems my next plan is actually start practicing building something from the scratch, or watch videos regarding the topic. 

the thing with the current session is that I wanted to build something. Learning by doing.

So in my case I’ll continue with the laracast video
