### On using the Claude Composer

It seems it was pretty intereseting to be able to use the Cursor Composer because it automatically edits the files for you and it was editing it.

Althought Earlier not sure what happens is that when I'm editing the MD files it deleteds some the rest of the sections. not sure what happens with that.

but it seems in was pretty interesting when I feed it with a simple instructions to be able to just do a basics adjustment on the code on making sure that the connections with the pushers was being reused multiple times
