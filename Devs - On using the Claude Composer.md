### On using the Claude Composer 

It seems it was pretty interesting to be able to use the Cursor Composer because it automatically edits the files for you andÂ 

it was editing it ( learned this one earlier with Ai overflow thanks Algef). I'm mostly using the chats before and the alternative one in PHPStorm haven't experiment much with the cursor composer

Although earlier not sure what happens is that when I'm editing the MD files it deleted some the rest of the sections. not sure what happens with that.


some interesting insights
- It automatically creates file it needs and it was importing it on the file you are editing

- Good to see that you don't need to copy paste the code ( although there is usually you can inline prompt but it was pretty great to  have some explanations of the edits. )

- seems in was pretty interesting when I feed it with a simple instructions to be able to just do a basics adjustment on the code on making sure that the connections with the pushers was being reused multiple times and it was able to nailed it with few fixes

- I guess this will be interesting to use when you are doing a refactoring of the codes ( making sure you save it first right and if you have some test in places)

- the challenge is make sure you read the code that it generates
